<h3> Messi´s childhood</h3>

<p> Messi was born the 06/24/1987 in the city of Rosario, Argentina. He started playing soccer at the age of 4 years and at six years old he was already in Newells old boys team. At the age of eleven his gransmother passed away and it really affected him because she was the reason he was having success. So now every time he scores a goal it is dedcated to her. Then at the same age he was detected with growth hormone deficiency. That is the reason he is kind of short and is 1.67m but he was supossed to be even shorter. He started a treatment for two years because his father inssuarnce covered it. However it was really expensive so he stoped at age of 13. </p>
